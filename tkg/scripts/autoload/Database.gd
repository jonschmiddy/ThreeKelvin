##
## Content is authored here as plain dictionaries and seeded into typed
## Resources at boot. Two reasons: it diffs cleanly in git, and tools/
## export_resources.gd can dump it to .tres files once you want to edit
## modules in the Godot inspector instead. Either way the rest of the
## codebase only ever sees ModuleData / HullData / EnemyTemplate.

## Loot-pool gate. While this is non-empty, only these manufacturers can drop;
## an empty array means every maker is live. Nothing is deleted — all 33 modules
## stay authored and seeded, so flipping a maker back on is a one-word edit and
## the sim can A/B a narrow pool against the full one.
##
## Brand-agnostic modules are never gated: Exotic is harvested and Artifact is
## precursor tech, so they have no manufacturer to gate on.
##
## REOPENED. This was [&"korvan"] while the card face and combat screen were
## being built, and the note here said to restore the full list before judging
## build variety. Manufacturer hulls are exactly that moment: you now pick a
## maker at run start, so a loot pool that can only drop Korvan would make six
## of the seven choices unplayable.

##
## Korvan keeps the five-module kit this game shipped with; the other six get
## their whole catalog, which is three or four modules. That asymmetry is real
## and is not a bug to pad out: with the hull counting as one toward its own
## set, three modules already clears the 3-piece bonus on turn one, and the
## empty hardpoints are what the run is FOR.
##
## Not all-Common, either. Korvan's five are C0 but Cygnet's cheapest is C1 and
## Halcyon's kit runs to C3, so some makers start meaningfully stronger. Left
## uncorrected on purpose — authoring starter-only variants to flatten it would
## be inventing content to solve a problem the sim has not confirmed exists.

# purchase; a recipe that costs "one precursor fragment" is a reason to have gone
# somewhere. Materials are what crafting is made of, and scrap is what it costs.

# `exotic` is not new. It has existed since megafauna did, as a bare int on
# RunState, and it is now simply the first row of this table — same number, same
# sources, one ledger. Everything that said `Run.exotic` still does.

# The fabricator, as data. Every recipe is {what it costs} -> {one effect the
# game already knows how to apply}, so adding one is a dictionary entry and
# never a new branch — the same law modules and cards are held to.
#
# `dev` is the minimum Development the place needs. Anywhere with a docking ring
# has a welder and a still; anything involving a laboratory needs a city. That is
# what makes the fabricator a REASON to visit a developed system rather than a
# button that follows you around the galaxy — and it is why the two basic recipes
# are dev 0. A station on unclaimed ground is still a station, and gating cheap
# fuel behind a flag on the wall is what strands people.
#
# Deliberately four. This is the stage crafting is built on, not crafting: the
# ledger, the recipe shape, the resolver and the place it happens. Recipes that
# reach into a specific module in the hold need a picker and a target, which is
# the next piece of work and not this one.
