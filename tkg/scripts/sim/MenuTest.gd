extends Harness

## The escape menu after the motion settings change under it:
##   godot --headless --path . -- menutest
##
## Jon: "Clicking reduced motion and/or clicking skip animations makes the
## escape menu lock up?" It did, on one path. A menu opened UNDER reduced motion
## never set its backdrop's `amount`, because only the animated way in set it.
## Turn reduced motion off in Settings and the way out is animated again, and
## `close` read that `amount`: null, `as float` threw, and `close` stopped
## halfway. Main had already let go of the menu, so it stayed up, swallowing
## every click, and Escape opened a second one over it.
##
## HEADLESS NEVER ANIMATES (`Router.animating`), which is why no test saw it.
## This one turns the animations on with `Router.animate_in_harness`, so the
## tweens and the animated close really run.
##
## Each case opens the menu with Escape, goes into Settings by its button,
## changes the motion settings, and then checks the menu still answers: Escape
## leaves Settings, BACK leaves Settings, Escape shuts the menu and it is GONE
## from the tree, and the ship screen takes its keys again. The settings are
## changed in memory and the panel redrawn, as the chip does, without the save:
## the player's settings file is never written.
