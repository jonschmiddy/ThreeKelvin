## The arrival screen, photographed:
##   godot --path . -- sectorshot [seed=N] [group]
##
## NEEDS A WINDOW. Under `--headless` the dummy display server never emits
## `frame_post_draw`, so nothing is captured and it looks exactly like a hang.
##
## IT EXISTS BECAUSE 8b IS A LAYOUT. `ENCOUNTER_FLOW.md` beat 2 is a drawing of a
## screen -- a group box, a check badge, a row per option -- and none of that is
## something an assert can look at. The list either reads or it does not.
##
## `group` hunts for a system carrying an EXCLUSIVE set, because that is the half
## of the design with no fallback: an independent option is one row and a group is
## the whole of rulings 1 and 1b. Without one on screen the shot proves the easy
## case.
